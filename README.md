# EVM Wallet (`evm-wallet.js`)

Cryptocurrency wallet for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible
blockchain networks written in Javascript based on the
[Ethers](
  https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) library and part of the
EVM Toolchain.

It depends on
[EVM Chains Info](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-info)
and
[EVM Chains Explorers](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-explorers)
in order to automatically retrieve informations about
blockchain networks, on
[key-gen](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/key-gen),
for which it is at the same time a seed-phrase provider,
to generate secrets,
and on the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
and
[Crash JavaScript](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-js)
run-time libraries.

It is a dependency for the
[EVM Contracts Tools](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-contracts-tools),
[libEVM](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/libevm),
and so all the programs depending on it, such as the
[EVM OpenPGP KeyServer](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-openpgp-keyserver),
the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
and the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
Life and DogeOS user repository and application store. 

## Installation

The wallet in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The program has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-wallet`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-wallet
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[evm-wallet-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet-ur).



A censorable binary build for the GNU and Android bases of
Life and
[DogeOS](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/dogeos),
also compatible with the Arch Linux distribution,
the Termux pacman-based environment and Windows
can be found on the
[Fur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur)
and it can be installed by typing

```bash
fur \
  evm-wallet
```

Direct links to the binary package can be directly accessed
through
[Github](
https://github.com/themartiancompany/fur/tree/evm-wallet)
in many ways.
Check the Fur documentation for more information.

The package has also been published
on the NPM Registry as
[`evm-wallet.js`](
  https://npmjs.com/packages/evm-wallet.js)
and so it can be installed from there by typing

```bash
npm \
  install \
    "evm-wallet.js"
```

Be aware the mirrors could go offline any time as Github or NPM and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
